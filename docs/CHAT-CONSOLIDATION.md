# Chat System Consolidation

## Overview

This update consolidates multiple chat-related files into a single, comprehensive `sessionService.js` file. This makes the codebase more maintainable by centralizing all chat functionality in one service.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new consolidated `sessionService.js` that integrates:
   - Chat message models (from `ChatMessage.js` and `EnhancedChatMessage.js`)
   - Chat route handling (from `chat.js`)
   - User mention functionality (from `userMentions.js`)

2. Updated `server.js` to:
   - Use the new sessionService for chat functionality
   - Remove redundant chat message handling code
   - Initialize the sessionService during server startup

3. Simplified the model registration by removing redundant imports

## Benefits

- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminates duplicate code across multiple files
- **Centralized Logic**: All chat functionality is now in a single service file
- **Improved Maintainability**: Makes future changes easier by having related code in one place
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between the chat service and other server functions

## How to Use

No changes are needed to existing client code or API calls. The refactoring maintains all current functionality while improving the code organization.

## Original Files Replaced

The following files are now consolidated into `sessionService.js`:
- `src/models/ChatMessage.js`
- `src/models/EnhancedChatMessage.js`
- `src/routes/chat.js`
- `src/utils/userMentions.js` (functionality)

Client-side code (`enhanced-chat.js`) is unchanged since it still needs to be accessible to the browser.
